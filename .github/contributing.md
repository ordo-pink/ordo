## Commit conventions

`ordo-electron` uses gitmoji commit convention.

- Every commit MUST start with a type represented by one of commit types listed on [gitmoji.dev](https://gitmoji.dev/). Do not use emoji icons - only code values (e.g. :art :, :sparkles :, etc.)
- Every commit MUST have a defined scope after the commit type, separated with a space (` `). Commit scope MUST be followed with a colon (`:`) and a space (` `). The scope MUST describe the area that the commit makes changes to (e.g. `activity bar: `, `editor: `, `readme: `, `electron.js: `, etc.)
- Every commit MUST have a short description of the commit content after the commit scope

### Most common commit types

- :sparkles : - adding new feature
- :bug : - fixing a bug
- :lock : - fixing security vulnerability
- :zap : - improving performance
- :lipstick : - making changes to the UI and styles
- :pencil : - updating docs
- :green_heart : - updating CI/CD configuration
- :white_check_mark : - updating/adding tests

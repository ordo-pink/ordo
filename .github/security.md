## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

If you see a way to hack Ordo or its dependencies, please let us know by creating a "Vulnerability"
issue. We'll investigate the risk, ask a few tough questions to our CTO, and get back to you if the
vulnerability is accepted. Please be sure to provide valid contact details.

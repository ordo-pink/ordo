Oath is a dependency free package that introduces laziness, cancellation and rejected branch type
definition support to your asynchronous code.

The Unlicense

## A benchmark of ten thousand, Mister Frisby

As the name suggests, each check was done _100,000_ times. The benchmarking was done with the
`benchmark.ts` (see the repo), running with **Bun v1.0.30** (`bun benchmark.ts`) and **Deno v2.0.0**
(`deno benchmark.ts`). The benchmarking was done on an Intel Core Ultra 5 laptop with 16Gb of RAM,
using Windows with Ubuntu inside WSL 2.0.

### Bun Results

| Oath time, ms | Promise time, ms | Oath method | Promise method |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| 0.0065        | 0.0021           | map         | then           |
| 0.0065        | 0.0021           | bimap       | then           |
| 0.0065        | 0.0021           | and         | then           |
| 0.0065        | 0.0021           | fix         | catch          |
| 0.0079        | 0.0011           | chain       | then           |

### Deno 2.0 Results

| Oath time, ms | Promise time, ms | Oath method | Promise method |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| 0.023         | 0.018            | map         | then           |
| 0.023         | 0.018            | bimap       | then           |
| 0.023         | 0.018            | and         | then           |
| 0.023         | 0.018            | fix         | catch          |
| 0.032         | 0.013            | chain       | then           |

As you can see, Oath is about 2 times slower than Promise.
